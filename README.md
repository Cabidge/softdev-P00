# Journal Square by Team: Mates and Forked by Wandering Wolverine

## Roles

- Andy Lin: backend
- Shadman Rakib: backend and database
- Raymond Yeung: frontend and website
- EDITORS: Wen Hao Dong, Rachel Xiao

## Notes
- The website was fully functional when the CSS was stripped away.
- We can have CSS variables by declaring them in ```:root{ --var: #FFFFFF }``` and accessing them using ```var(<var_name>)```
- We can style individual input types of a form using ``input[type=<input_type>] { }```
- The gap property in CSS is a shorthand for row-gap and column-gap, specifying the size of gutters, which is the space between rows and columns within grid, flex, and multi-column layouts.
